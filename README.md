# Atliq Technologies Presence Insights

I have used the dataset provided by codebasics.

### The Dashboard provides Presence Insights of the employees: 
- Developed a Dashboard for Presence, Work From Home, and Sick Leave of the employees of AtliQ Technologies.
- The analysis is done on various parameters to give a proper insight into the requirement mentioned by HR.

###  I've Created the following KPIs using DAX :
- Present Days
- WFH Count
- SL Count
- Presence %
- Work From Home %
- Sick Leave %

### Some Key Insights:
- We can clearly see that, Presence % decreases over time while the sick leave % increases over time. This indicates that People are taking sick leaves and its increasing over the period of time.
- Monday holds the highest presence and Friday is the least. We can make friday as Work from home, it has the ability to increase productivity while decreasing the People's absence on fridays.
